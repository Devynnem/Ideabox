### Abstract:
We built a web application that stores users ideas. They are able to favorite and delete the ideas updating the DOM and the Data Model.
This application solves the problem of forgetting your brilliant thoughts.

### Installation Instructions:
> The steps a person would take to clone down and run the app would be as follows:
> 1. Fork the GitHub repository [file](https://github.com/AshleeAWebb/Ideabox).
> 2. Using the git clone command on their terminal, they could initiate a copy of the required files.
> 3. Once they have cloned the application, they would be able to cd into the directory, and using the open index.HTML string of text it would open the application in their own web browsers so they could enjoy the functionality of the application.

### Context:
This is our 1st group project in Module 1. We have completed 3 projects prior to working on this one. We all worked together as a team and spent approximately 36 hours of group work time trading off driving and navigation.

### Learning Goals:
We worked with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The learning goals of this project were to gain an understanding on how to write clean HTML and CSS. We also learned the relationship between the DOM and Data Module and what it looks like. We utilized arrays to manipulate what is being displayed and to make clean DRY code that operates small functions.

### Wins + Challenges:
Challenges: We struggled with manipulating the grid in combination with flex boxes to replicate the comp. We also were challenge when trying to figure out the favorite button updating it to the data module. We couldn't figure out how to target the unique ID of the favorite icon without putting in two ID's.

Wins: We were respectful of peoples' time, we were fleixble and all worked around each other schedules to exert maximum effort. We were able to use skills and knowledge with little outside assistance to create a functional web application.
